Index file
----------

Entries are sorted by due date in ascending order.

	itemname "\t" due "\t" scheduler "\t" reps "\t" ease

due - due date in days since Jan 1 1970 (UTC)
scheduler - scheduler ID, e.g. "sm2"
(SM2-specific)
reps - repetition count, reset on failed review
ease - E-factor

Scheduler log
-------------

proposed changes:
 - single log file for all entries (would get big /really fast/, but could avoid polluting the file system with lots of tiny (<4k) files)
 - use seconds for due date (rounded to next day maybe), some algorithms (e.g. ebisu) make use of more granular due dates

	scheduler "\n" [schedline "\n"...]

scheduler - scheduler ID, e.g. "sm2"
schedline:

	revdate "\t" interval "\t" ease "\t" lapse

revdate - review date in seconds since Jan 1 1970 (UTC)
(SM2-specific)
interval - how many days (starting from revdate minus 1) until the item appears again
ease - E-factor
lapse - "lapse" if the item was not correctly recalled, "" otherwise
